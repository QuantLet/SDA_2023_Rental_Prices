Name of QuantLet : 'SDA_2023_Rental_Prices'

Published in : 'SDA_Rental_Prices'

Description : 'To scrap and analyze real estate rental prices in Zurich using diverse machine learning techniques. Data on housing advertisements from https://www.immobilier.ch, combined with spatial data from https://data.stadt-zuerich.ch/. Creation of spatial maps, evaluation of predictive model performance through diverse machine learning techniques, and analysis of variable importance.

The project intended to extract and clean web data from Immobilier.ch for the region of Zurich. In addition, shapefiles from open-source Zurich Stadt allow us to leverage spatial data and create more covariates to perform predictive analysis.

Please ensure that you download all the files within this folder before executing the code and follow the instructions below to reproduce our results:

Download the files on your machines Make sure to extract zip files. In particular, merge the content of "ZH canton part 1" and "ZH canton part 2" into a single folder called "ZH canton" Download the shapefile called "Gebäudealter.shp" on the following page: https://data.stadt-zuerich.ch/dataset/ktzh_gebaeudealter__ogd_ and save it in folder "ZH canton" as well.

Run Immobilier.ch_scrapping_Selenium.py Keep in mind that Selenium takes quie some time to run depending on the number of pages to scrap. Make sure to remove the comment mark (#) on lines 116, 317 and 366 to save your datasets.

Run Spatial_analysis_ZH.py to load shapefiles and create new covariates Keep in mind that Nominatim API doesn't allow to perform more than 1 request per second (don't touch the time.sleep(1)) Make sure to remove the comment mark (#) on lines 40, 119 and 142 to save your datasets.

Download both Final_Project_Group_1 and Final_Project_Group_1_Functions to obtain Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), Word Cloud, and Predictive models.

Feel free to consult quantinar.com to learn more about the techniques used. Have fun!'
